# -- PyPI trails the tags -- and the mismatch fails the app's readiness probe
# with 401 Unauthorized. So keep it away from whatever `hermes` is on PATH,
# which on Omarchy is the mise CLI installed for the terminal agent, and let
# the app provision and manage its own runtime under ~/.hermes. That is the
# arrangement upstream ships, and the only one that starts.
